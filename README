SMAC - Short Message Arithmetic Compressor
------------------------------------------
(C) Paul Gardner-Stephen 2012-2013.

SMAC compresses SMS and Twitter like messages to around half of their original size, often less.
It uses a compressed pre-computed multi-order dictionary to feed probabilities to an arithmetic coder.
It offers full unicode support, and accepts UTF-8 strings.  
Using redundancy in the UTF-8 format, SMAC offers the feature that it never increases
the length of a string during compression, and uncompressed strings can be passed to 
the decompressor without causing problems.
