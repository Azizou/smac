const-correct the source code
release the ruby script to build new specialized dictionaries
play well against currupted input in verbatim 253/254 codes memcpy()
play with some form of entropy coding like Huffman or range coding

tweet_freq:
- flip case of "I" when a word
- gather stats on all upper-case words and try encoding case that way
  (should be good for long strings of upper case characters as well)
- gather stats on what fraction of words compress using 3rd-order symbol
  model, and start each word with a symbol that selects whether to use
  that model, or to use flat statistics. really this is the beginning of
  what should be a more general solution of using dynamic programming to
  optimise selection of different models at different points, and determining
  the optimal cost for model-switching.
- rle encoding option for long strings of same character?
